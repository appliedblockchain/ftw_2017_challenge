#### General Guidelines

2. Create a Github [Gist](https://gist.github.com) with your Metamask ethereum address [Switching from mainnet] - ( https://gist.github.com/YOUR_USER/COMMIT )


3. Visit the Testnet Faucet and claim your test Ethers: [rinkeby.etherscan.io](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io)


4. Check the transaction for confirmation ( https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/YOUR_ADDRESS )
